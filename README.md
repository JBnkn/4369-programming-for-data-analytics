Repository for the 2024 [Programming for Data Analytics](https://www.atu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-science-data-analytics#:~:text=Programming%20for%20Data%20Analytics) module as part of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) at ATU. 

This module comprised of two components: a series of assignments and a core project.

## [Assignments](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/tree/main/Assignments)

Further detail on the work I did for each assignment can be found in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook, which I have linked to below.

### Assignment 2 - [Weather](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment2-weather.ipynb)
> Create a plot showing temperature over time.

### Assignment 3 - [Pie](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment3-pie.ipynb)
> Create a piechart showing the distribution of email domains within a sample CSV.

### Assignment 5 - [Risk](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment_5_risk.ipynb)
> Simulate 1000 battle rounds in Risk.

### Assignment 6 - [Weather](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment_6_Weather.ipynb)
> Pull weather data from link provided and plot various pieces of data.

## [Project](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Project/Dublinbikes%20Project.ipynb)

The brief provided for the core project was:

> Write a notebook that demonstrates what you have learned in the Module, if you can not think of an area you wish to explore, then create a project that analyses windspeed for windfarms.

As I have an interest is public transport, library-type sharing systems, and the movement towards better utilisation of public service data, I have decided to interrogate some of the freely available data for the [Dublinbikes](https://www.dublinbikes.ie/) bike-sharing scheme.

### Modules

Modules used in the course of this project were:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) for data manipulation
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, tick formatting, and creating GIFs
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualisations
- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/#) for mapping
- [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) for datetime manipulation
