Repository for the 2024 [Programming for Data Analytics](https://www.atu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-science-data-analytics#:~:text=Programming%20for%20Data%20Analytics) module as part of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) at ATU, delivered by  

This module comprised of two components: a series of assignments and a core project.

## [Assignments](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/tree/main/Assignments)

Further detail on the work I did for each assignment can be found in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook, which I have linked to below.

### Assignment 2 - [Weather](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment2-weather.ipynb)
> Create a plot showing temperature over time.

### Assignment 3 - [Pie](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment3-pie.ipynb)
> Create a piechart showing the distribution of email domains within a sample CSV.

### Assignment 5 - [Risk](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment_5_risk.ipynb)
> Simulate 1000 battle rounds in Risk.

### Assignment 6 - [Weather](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment_6_Weather.ipynb)
> Pull weather data from link provided and plot various pieces of data.

## [Project](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Project/Dublinbikes%20Project.ipynb)

The brief provided for the core project was:

> Write a notebook that demonstrates what you have learned in the Module, if you can not think of an area you wish to explore, then create a project that analyses windspeed for windfarms.

As I have an interest is public transport, library-type sharing systems, and the movement towards better utilisation of public service data, I have decided to interrogate some of the freely available data for the [Dublinbikes](https://www.dublinbikes.ie/) bike-sharing scheme.

### Project Overview
In this project, I explored and analysed data from to Dublin's bike-sharing system, DublinBikes, to uncover insights about bike station usage, peak times, and station performance. This project demonstrates how data analytics techniques can be applied to real-world public service data to enhance transportation efficiency.

Key aspects of the project included:
- Analysing bike station data and geographic distribution
- Identifying peak usage times based on time of day, and day of week
- Visualising map-based data on a map to illustrate bike station locations
- Leveraging time-series analysis to explore patterns in bike availability and demand

### Modules

Modules used in the course of this project were:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) for data manipulation
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, tick formatting, and creating GIFs
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualisations
- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/#) for mapping
- [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) for datetime manipulation

You can explore the full project in the [DublinBikes Project Notebook](https://github.com/JBnkn/4369-programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Project/Dublinbikes%20Project.ipynb).

### Resources

The resource videos delivered by [Dr. Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware) were of great assistance in displaying the practical utility of many programming approaches to data analytics. I am also heavily indebted to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) which was an invaluable tool, primarily in troubleshooting my code when I couldn't quite make it work, or asking it to break down a piece of code and explain to me step-by-step what was happening at each point.
